## Howdy, developer!

Hapify was born out of the desire to **accelerate modern development**, by replacing traditional statics boilerplates with **dynamic boilerplates**. Hapify removes the need to write repeating boilerplate for extended CRUD operations for both backend & frontend development. Focus on features instead of doing repetitive work !

- Hapify is an agnostic code engine & tools allowing the creation of any kind of API based app, in any language
- Hapify takes two inputs, the relational data-models and code templates.
- Hapify does not command any paradigm or code structure. You can write your own code templates or use the ones provided by the community.
