# Roadmap

## Short-term

- ~~Use local `hapify-generator`.~~
- ~~Import `hapify-gui` pre-built package as dependency.~~
- ~~Cleanup interfaces definitions.~~
- Contextualize websocket config file with http host. We should be able to open multiple web console for multiple projects.
- Do not override all templates on saving. We should be able to work with multiple editors simultaneously.
- ~~Ability to name project on `new` and `init` commands.~~
- ~~Ability to store models in multiple local projects at the same time.~~

## Medium-term

- Strong use of TypeScript definitions. No `any` allowed.
- ~~Add automated tests suite.~~
- ~~Ability to store models locally (no account on hapify.io needed).~~

## Long-term
